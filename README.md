A note about images on the web
You do not have the legal right to use just any image that you find on the web. There are many free images to be found, but make sure that the image you use is actually free for you to use, and make sure to credit the creator of the image in your project. An easy way to give credit is to put the creatorâ€™s name and contact info in a README file in your repository. Some good places to find free-to-use images on the web include Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash.
